## Description
The simple interest calculator computes the interest based on:
- Principal amount
- Rate of interest
- Time period (in years)

## Formula
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Example
If the principal is 1000, the rate is 5%, and the time is 2 years:

Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100

## Usage
